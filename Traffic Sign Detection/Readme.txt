1. Open P4_Submission and go to folder 'vlfeat-0.9.21'

2. vlfeat-0.9.21 -> toolbox -> open and run "vl_setup.m"
now -> write "vl_version" in matlab command window to check if installed properly.

3. Then Copy the input dataset in the input folder. i.e. 
P4 submission -> input -> TSR -> input(paste the files here)

4. Now open code folder and run "TrafficSign_Recognition.m" to generate the output video.

5. The generated output video is stored in the output folder

Note - I have included sample sign images in the sample folder(input->TSR->Sample).
These image are required to spawn correct sign image on the bounding box  

if you have any questions. Please let me know.
Thanks,
